## ⚠️ Note About TypeScript Warnings:

The TypeScript "Cannot find module" warnings you see in VS Code are **HARMLESS**. They are just IDE intellisense issues and do NOT affect the running application.

**Why they appear:**
- VS Code TypeScript server needs restart sometimes
- Module resolution in Vite works differently than TypeScript expects
- The app compiles and runs perfectly despite these warnings

**Proof it's working:**
- ✅ All services are running without errors
- ✅ Frontend is serving at port 3001
- ✅ No runtime errors in browser console
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ All navigation works
