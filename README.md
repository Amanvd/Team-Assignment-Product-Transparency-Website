## üí≠ Development Reflection

### How We Used AI Tools in Development

AI tools (GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT) significantly accelerated our development process. We used AI for code generation, particularly for repetitive patterns like API routes, database schemas, and React components, which allowed us to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate. AI proved invaluable for debugging, helping us quickly resolve TypeScript errors, CORS issues, and JWT token handling problems. Security best practices were suggested by AI, including input validation with Zod schemas, bcrypt password hashing, and proper CORS configurations. AI also assisted in generating comprehensive documentation and implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints. Rather than replacing development skills, AI acted as an intelligent pair programmer, offering suggestions that we evaluated and customized for our specific needs.

### Architecture & Design Principles

Our architecture follows a **microservices-inspired design** with three independent services (Frontend, Backend, AI Service), enabling independent scaling and technology flexibility. We adopted a **security-first approach**, implementing JWT authentication, input validation at multiple layers, and CORS protection from the start. The **user-centric design** principle guided our product transparency logic, breaking complex data entry into a multi-step form and providing clear visual score breakdowns with actionable insights. Our **transparency scoring system** is built on four equally-weighted pillars (Environmental Impact, Supply Chain, Ethics, Certifications) because we believe true transparency requires balance across all dimensions. We designed for **scalability** using stateless services, async operations, and optimized database queries. Finally, the **progressive enhancement** principle ensures core functionality remains available even if one service is down, with appropriate fallbacks and error handling throughout the system.
